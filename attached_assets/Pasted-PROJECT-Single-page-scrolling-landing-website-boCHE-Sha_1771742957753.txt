PROJECT: Single-page scrolling landing website — boCHE & ShakesBierre
Stack: React + Framer Motion + Tailwind (or vanilla HTML/CSS/JS — developer's choice)
Goal: Premium hospitality conversion page. Every pixel must feel like ₹3,00,000 of craft.

1. DESIGN SYSTEM
Color Palette — strict:
--black:        #000000
--black-rich:   #080500  (primary section bg)
--charcoal:     #110D00  (alternate section bg)
--gold:         #C9942A
--gold-bright:  #FFD700
--gold-pale:    #F0D080
--gold-gradient: linear-gradient(135deg, #8B6914, #FFD700, #C9942A, #FFD700, #8B6914)
--red-neon:     #FF2244  (boCHE accent ONLY — do not remove)
--white:        #FFFFFF
--cream:        #F5E6C8
Typography:

Display/Hero headings → Cinzel Decorative (Google Fonts, weight 900) — matches "SHAKESBIERRE" logo letterforms
Section headings → Cinzel (weight 600–700)
Body/descriptions → Cormorant Garamond (weight 300–400, italic for quotes)
boCHE brand name → bold white sans-serif, slightly rounded (match logo chunky style — use Nunito Black or Poppins 900)
"Club" accent word → Dancing Script Bold in #FF2244 with red text-shadow neon glow effect

Textures (implement as layered CSS/canvas):

Primary BG: Pure #000 with animated CSS radial-gradient gold shimmer breathing slowly
Stardust Layer: A canvas or CSS particle system creating floating gold dust particles — this is NON-NEGOTIABLE, it is the brand's signature visual (reference Logo 2's glitter halo and Logo 3's gold column splashes)
Alternate sections: #110D00 charcoal with a subtle noise texture overlay at 3% opacity
Section dividers: Full-width ★ ─────── ★ ─────── ★ in gold, animated fade-in on scroll

Global Effects:

Custom cursor: small gold dot + larger gold ring (mix-blend-mode: difference)
Parallax depth on all hero and section images (scroll-driven)
All text reveals: character-by-character or word-by-word stagger using Framer Motion (staggerChildren: 0.04)
Scroll-triggered entrance: elements slide up + fade in with gold shimmer flash on arrival
Page load: full-screen theatrical curtain reveal (gold line draws across then splits open)
